## Interface

The Game is devided into a top and bottom part.
The top half shows a topdown view of an 2D office. This part crows over time dependent on the correct answers of the player. The higher the "TrusScore" the bigger the office expands and the more objects and npcs are there.

The bottom half of the screen displays an desk with objects on it.
The objects are:
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Notebook

On the top left of the Screen is an Pointbar as well as a Level indicator. Those represent the TrustValue score and the regarding current Level (of the Office) .

### Laptop
When clicking on the Laptop, a canvas which spans over more then 2/3 of the whole screen is opened. This mimics a computer screen. On the screen the ImageGame is opened. 

#### ImageGame
The Image game is the central game piece of this Game. Here images are displayed, and the user goes over different steps on an interface:
- Decision about real and fake 
  - Here the player decides if he thinks the image is real or fake and then clickes okay
- Mark 
  - If the player clicked fake, the marked part is visable. Here the player either clicks on the image to mark the position which indicated to him that the image is fake or he checks "overall" to indicate that the overall feeling of the image tickt him off
- Confidence
  - The confidence part is visable either after clicking deciding real or after marking the image in case of a fake. Here the player rates his confidence in his decision from 1 to 10 over a slider and then confirms it

#### Rest of the screen
On the rest of the visual computer screen the current score of this round is saved. Once the screen is closed through the home button, those points will be added to the overall TrustValue score.
